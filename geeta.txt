The Price of Desire

Geeta's fingers trembled as she polished the brass handles of Madam's favorite cabinet. Six months had passed since that first stolen glance with Rajesh sir, when their eyes met in the kitchen mirror as she served his morning tea. Now, every surface in this luxurious house held memories of their secret encounters – the utility room where he first kissed her, the garden shed where they shared whispered promises.

But lately, something had changed. The shadows in the corners of the house seemed deeper, darker. Objects moved when no one was around. At first, Geeta dismissed it as her guilty conscience playing tricks. Until the day she found her dupatta neatly arranged on Madam's bed, though she hadn't entered that room all day.

That evening, as she prepared dinner, she heard Madam's anklets jingling upstairs. The sound shouldn't have been possible – Madam was visiting her parents in Pune. The delicate musical notes grew closer, descending the staircase. cham... cham... cham...

Geeta's heart pounded as she turned towards the kitchen door. Empty. But the mirror showed a different story. Behind her reflection stood Madam, her face contorted in an unnatural smile, eyes gleaming with otherworldly knowledge.

"Did you think I wouldn't know?" The voice came from everywhere and nowhere.

Geeta spun around, but the kitchen remained empty. In the mirror, Madam's reflection raised a finger to her lips, her smile widening impossibly. "We all pay for our sins, Geeta. Some sooner... some later."

The lights flickered. When they stabilized, Madam's reflection was gone. But Geeta wasn't alone in the kitchen anymore. On the counter lay a fresh mangalsutra – identical to the one Madam wore – its black beads glistening wetly, as if recently dipped in something dark and thick.

That night, Rajesh sir didn't come home. The police found his car wrapped around a tree on the highway, empty. They never found his body. But sometimes, on quiet evenings, Geeta hears two sets of anklets jingling upstairs, accompanied by familiar masculine footsteps. She doesn't go up to check anymore. She knows better now.

These days, she keeps her eyes fixed on her work, avoiding all mirrors in the house. But occasionally, when she catches a glimpse of her reflection, she sees three figures standing behind her – Madam, Rajesh sir, and a third shape, growing clearer with each passing day, waiting to welcome her into their eternal dance.
